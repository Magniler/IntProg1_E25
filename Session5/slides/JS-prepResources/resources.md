# Learn JS resources

These resources are going to help you code some more and be totally prepared for the exam. Some offer a few free modules or courses, and some are totally free.

[JSchallenger.com](JSchallenger.com) - Offers a lot of different modules in their JavaScript basics course, but they do put a limit on what you can do fro free. Pick and choose what you need to practice for the exam

[Codecadamy beginner JS course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) - A full course on Javascript. You do not have to do everything in order to pass this exam, but the first couple of modules might be very good to get you comfortable with writing short programs

[Coding JS](https://the-winter.github.io/codingjs/) - Opens source coding challenges. Some are beyond this course, and some are going to be a bit tough, but they are all completly free and you are able to save your progress. Very good place to practice

[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53af2b8861023f1d88000832/train/javascript) - A 'gamefied' and challenge driven approach to learn programming. Most of their challenges are more advanced than this course, but they can for some be more fun.

[Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com) - 16 free lessons on Javascript. Is about the same as JSchallenger, but more text heavy and less generous
