## Coding section

For the following questions, you are expected to write JavaScript code to answer them. Small syntax errors in your solution **are okay**, and you will still be able to get full marks. Focus on solving the problem that is asked in the question, and in the way that is defined in the question.

### In JavaScript, write a loop that shows the numbers from 1 to 100 to the user using console.log().


### In JavaScript, write a program that creates an array of at least 3 fruits, then uses a loop to display each fruit to the user using console.log().

### In Javascript, write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum

### In JavaScript, write a program where you:

    1. Declare a variable named `age` with the value of 21
    2. Creates a conditional statement that checks if age meets one of the following criteria:
       1. "child" from age 0-12
       2. "teen" from age 13-19
       3. "adult" from 20-64
       4. "senior" from 65 and above
    3. Show the age group, based on the `age` variable, to the user using console.log()

### In JavaScript, declare a car object with the following attributes:

Attributes:
make (string): The manufacturer of the car
model (string): The model of the car
year (number): The year the car was made
mileage (number): The current milage of the car

Then write a function that takes a `car` object as argument and prints it mileage. Call it `mileage()`.
