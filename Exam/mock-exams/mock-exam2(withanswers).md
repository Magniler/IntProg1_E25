## Part 2: Written Questions (25%)

1. Explain the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript. When would you use each?
   - `let` declares a block-scoped variable that can be changed. Use it for variables that will change.
   - `const` declares a block-scoped constant that cannot be reassigned. Use it for values that should not change.
   - `var` declares a function-scoped variable (older style). Avoid using it in modern code.

2. Describe what an array is and give an example of how to create and access an array in JavaScript.
   - An array is a list-like object used to store multiple values. Example: `let arr = [1, 2, 3];` Access: `arr[0]` is 1.

3. What is the purpose of an `if...else` statement? Write a short example.
   - It allows you to run different code depending on a condition. Example:
     ```js
     if (x > 0) {
       console.log("Positive");
     } else {
       console.log("Not positive");
     }
     ```

## Part 3: Code Questions (25%)

1. Write a function called `multiply` that takes two numbers and returns their product.
   ```js
   function multiply(a, b) {
     return a * b;
   }
   ```

2. Given the array `let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]`, write code to print each color to the console using a loop.
   ```js
   let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
   for (let color of colors) {
     console.log(color);
   }
   ```

3. Write a program that asks the user for their age (using `prompt`) and prints "Adult" if the age is 18 or above, and "Minor" otherwise.
   ```js
   let age = Number(prompt("Enter your age:"));
   if (age >= 18) {
     console.log("Adult");
   } else {
     console.log("Minor");
   }
   ```
