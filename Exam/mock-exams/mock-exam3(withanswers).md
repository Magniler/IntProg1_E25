## Part 2: Written Questions (25%)

1. What is a function parameter? Give an example.
   - A function parameter is a variable listed in the function definition that receives a value when the function is called. Example:
     ```js
     function greet(name) {
       console.log("Hello, " + name);
     }
     ```

2. Explain the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript.
   - `==` compares values for equality after type conversion. `===` compares both value and type (strict equality).

3. What is the purpose of a loop? Write a short example using a `while` loop.
   - A loop repeats a block of code multiple times. Example:
     ```js
     let i = 0;
     while (i < 3) {
       console.log(i);
       i++;
     }
     ```

2. Given the array `let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, write code to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.

     sum += num;
   }
   console.log(sum); // 15
   ```

3. Write a program that asks the user for their name and prints a greeting using that name.
