## Part 2: Written Questions (25%)

1. What is the difference between an array and an object in JavaScript? Give an example of each.
   - An array is an ordered list of values, e.g. `let arr = [1, 2, 3]`. An object is a collection of key-value pairs, e.g. `let obj = {name: "Alice", age: 22}`.

2. Describe what a loop is and why it is useful. Give an example using a `for` loop.
   - A loop repeats code multiple times. Example:
     ```js
     for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
       console.log(i);
     }
     ```

3. What is the purpose of the `prompt` function? Write a short example.
   - It asks the user for input. Example:
     ```js
     let name = prompt("Enter your name:");
     console.log(name);
     ```

## Part 3: Code Questions (25%)

1. Write a function called `greetUser` that takes a name as a parameter and prints a greeting.
   ```js
   function greetUser(name) {
     console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
   }
   ```

2. Given the array `let nums = [2, 4, 6, 8]`, write code to print only the even numbers using a loop.
   ```js
   let nums = [2, 4, 6, 8];
   for (let n of nums) {
     if (n % 2 === 0) {
       console.log(n);
     }
   }
   ```

3. Write a program that asks the user for a number and prints whether it is positive, negative, or zero.
   ```js
   let num = Number(prompt("Enter a number:"));
   if (num > 0) {
     console.log("Positive");
   } else if (num < 0) {
     console.log("Negative");
   } else {
     console.log("Zero");
   }
   ```
