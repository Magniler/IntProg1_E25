# PRODAY 2: Objects, Objects, Objects

Welcome to your second independent PRO-DAY! The purpose of this day is to continue strengthening your understanding of JavaScript and the DOM, while also getting you more comfortable with more advanced datatypes such as `array`'s and `object`'s

The day is again structured into some reading assignments and some coding assignments. If you feel comfortable with the subject of datatypes in JavaScript, please feel free to go directly to the coding assignments. Otherwise, use the reading assignments as a way to repeat the concepts from yesterdays classroom session

For this day i have also put in a structured revision assignment, to help you revisit some of the earlier concepts we have looked at

## Mock-exam assignment

I have uploaded the mock exam as a separate PDF under the Session 4 module on Canvas. You should try to answer the questions on it in order to get a feel for how the exam is structured. If you want to do it in a way that looks like the proper exam, you should set a timer for 30 minutes to complete the tasks (as it is half size of the proper exam).

While you do it (or afterwards) please note *what confuses you and what you do not know*. Write down what questions/concepts you are having a tough time understanding, and then be prepared to talk about them on Fridays session. If you do not feel comfortable presenting this on class, please write your questions as an email to Magnus (magl@eaaa.dk), and he will bring it in as anonymous feedback.

## Reading assignment 1

Read up on how objects in JS work on this Javascript.info [here](https://javascript.info/object-basics). Read the first chapter, 'Objects' and the second chapter 'Objects reference and Copying'

Also, read op on how Array's work in JS [here](https://javascript.info/data-types) - Read the chapters 'Arrays' and 'Array methods'

**Remember** to do the exercises at the buttom - they are great for understanding!

## Reading assignment 2

We have been going over functions kind of quickly, soo please read the javascript.info introduction to functions [here](https://javascript.info/function-basics) - Read the chapters 'Function' and the next one 'Functions Expressions'

**Remember** to do the exercises at the buttom - they are great for understanding!

## Coding assignment 1

Finish up the work on the sign-up page until at least task 5. Use the worksheet from yesterdays class session. You can work in the groups you did in class, or independently

## Coding assignment 2

Here you will have 2 assignments to choose from: Either a YT video turtorial or a written turtorial written by me.

### Video turtorial

We are going to continue with freecodecamps turtorials, this time with the 'Reviews' turtorial ([link](https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4?si=zhmH4EAvn3sudmgj&t=2645)). The setup is the same as last time, soo it should be quick for you guys to get into

### Written turtorial: Make a grocery list

This is going to be a bit of a challenge: You will have **no start code**, only a list of tasks and specifications. You should write the HTML, CSS and JavaScript from the bottom, but the HTML should be simple enough.

You can use a lot of the start code that was provided in the TODO example. I would recommend you to not worry to much about the CSS, but please fell free to do it as you wish.

#### Task 1: Get started

First write the HTML for the list. It should contain:

- A container to center the list
- A heading to write the name of the list
- An input field for the user to input new items
- A button to submit the new items
- A `div` or list where all the items can be put into

... And whatever you decide should also be in the list (A date field? Multiple lists for different days?)

#### Task 2: Get the JavaScript started

Soo now you have a basic webside, but no functionality. Your grocery list should have the following functionality:

- You should be able to add items to the list
- The list should display all items as a list
- You should have buttons on the items to change/delete them
- there should be a ´clear all items´ button that clears all items

... And whatever functionality ypu think should be implemented

You can use a lot of the code you have written for the other assignments we have done. The tricky part is to start building up a project by yourself
