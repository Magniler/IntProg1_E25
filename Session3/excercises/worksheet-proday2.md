# PRO-DAY 2 Worksheet

This worksheet defines the tasks that you should complete for your individual workday, PRO-DAY 2.

The tasks are divided into a reading portion and a practical tutorial portion. For this tutorial, i have found a YouTube video-turtorial guiding you on how to create a JavScript project. 

## First task: Read for Wednesday

On Wednesday we will take a look at advanced data structure in Javascript. You can find the reading [here](https://eaaa.instructure.com/courses/29340/pages/purpose-and-preparation-advanced-data-structures?module_item_id=845375). Please finish this as your first task

## Second task: Read more about the DOM and JavaScript

[Javascript.info](Javascript.info) is a relativly new and comprehensive online 'book' of the javascript language. They have several articles on all parts of the JavaScript language. It provides interactive guide and code sections, which hopefully should anchor your understanding.

As preparation for Wednesday, you should read the 'Document' chapter ([link](https://javascript.info/document)), until sub-chapter 8. 'Styles and Classes' (soo don't read chapter 9, 10 and 11).
Each chapter often has a few interactive exercises at the bottom, which are very good to do for you understanding of JavaScript.

## Third task: Build a color picker

For this task, you will be following along a YT-tutorial provided by freecodecamp.org ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4))

You should complete the first project that is described by this tutorial (That is the 'Intro' section + the 'Color Flipper' section, about the first 30 minutes of video.)

At the end of it, you should have made a complete color flipper in Javascript and HTML.
