## ![](media/image2.jpeg)Exercise: Decomposition and Sequence

Decomposition and sequence are fundamental concepts in programming that
often work together to solve complex problems efficiently.

**Decomposition**

Decomposition involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller,
more manageable parts. This makes it easier to understand, develop, and
maintain the system.

**Sequence**

Sequence refers to the specific order in which instructions(statements)
are executed in a computer program. It ensures that tasks are performed
in a logical and correct order.

**Connection Between Decomposition and Sequence**

When you decompose a problem, you create smaller tasks or modules that
need to be executed in a specific sequence to achieve the overall goal.

**Example**

Let's say that you want to instruct a humanoid robot to do a peanut
butter sandwich. The robot can only receive one statement at a the time.
Therefore, you decompose the sandwich making into smaller tasks and
makes the robot follow them in a sequence of statements:

1.  Identify the ingredients: 2 slices of bread, peanut butter.

2.  Identify the tools: butter knife, plate.

3.  Collect the ingredients and tools from their storage locations.

4.  Clear a clean surface.

5.  Place the plate on the clean surface.

6.  Locate the jar of peanut butter.

7.  Unscrew the lid of the jar.

8.  Pick up the butter knife.

9.  Insert the knife into the jar.

10. Scoop out a generous amount of peanut butter.

11. Place one slice of bread on the plate.

12. Spread the peanut butter evenly on one side of the bread slice.

13. Repeat for the second slice of bread.

14. Pick up one slice of bread.

15. Place it on top of the other slice, with the peanut butter sides
    facing each other.

16. Ensure the sandwich is centered on the plate.

17. Pick up the butter knife.

18. Cut the sandwich diagonally.

19. Close the jar of peanut butter by screwing the lid back on.

20. Wash the butter knife.

21. Return the ingredients and tools to their storage locations.

22. Wipe down the workspace.

**Now it is your turn!**

1.  Discuss the logic of the sequence of statements about making a
    sandwich with your wingwoman/man. Is it possible for certain
    statements, that they can have a different order than the one used?
    Are there statements that [must]{.underline} be executed before
    other statements are carried out?

2.  Imagine you are a teacher who needs to calculate the average grade
    of three exams for each student in your class and show the result of
    the calculation on the computer screen. Instead of doing the
    calculation on a calculator, you have decided to design a computer
    program.\
    \
    You start by using your everyday English to decompose the problem
    and specify a sequence of statements the computer must do. It is
    common, that a statement starts with a word in imperative form, like
    "Wash", "Wipe", "Pick up", "Cut" and so on.\
    \
    What will the sequence of statements look like for your grade
    calculation program?\
    \
    Write your suggestion down below.

3.  Discuss your solution with your wingwoman/-man.
