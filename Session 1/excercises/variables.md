## Exercises: Variables, datatypes, operators and string manipulation

These exercises are designed to help you build a strong foundation in
handling variables and data types, which are essential skills for any
programmer. By the end of these exercises, you'll be more comfortable
with declaring variables, performing operations on them, and
manipulating strings to achieve desired outcomes.

### Exercise 1: Declaring Variables and Primitive Data Types

**Declare Variables:**

- Declare a mutable variable *myAge* and assign it a value of 25

- Declare a immutable variable *myHeight* and assign it a value of 5.9

- Declare a immutable variable myN*ame* and assign it your name.

- Declare a mutable variable *isStudent* and assign it a value of True.

### Exercise 2: Performing Operations

**Arithmetic Operations:**

- Create two mutable integer variables *a* and *b* with values 10 and
  20, respectively.

- Increment the value of *a* by 1 and decrement the value of *b* by the
  value of *a*. Store the results in new variables and display them
  using console.log(variable name);

- Perform examples of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
  division on these variables and store the results in variables, one
  variable for each arithmetic calculation. Display the results using
  *console.log(variable name);*

### Exercise 3: Manipulating Strings

**String Concatenation:**

- Create two string variables *firstName* and *lastName*. The values
  must be your first name and last name respectively.

<!-- -->

- Concatenate these strings to form a full name and store the result in
  a variable. Display the result using *console.log(variable name);*

**String Methods:**

- Create a string variable with the value "Hello, World!".

- Store the results in variables and display them using
  *console.log(variable name).* Use string methods to:

  - Convert the string to uppercase.

  - Convert the string to lowercase.

  - Identify and display only the "World" word using substring method.

### Exercise 4: Combining Concepts

How can one handle user inputs in JavaScript? Have a look at the
*prompt()* method:
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt>. Read
the complete documentation -- also the notes paragraph. Why must you use
the *Number()* method? You can try without and see what happens.

**Create a Simple Program:**

Write a program that asks the user for a student name and three grades.
Store these inputs in appropriate variables. Perform an arithmetic
operation that calculates the average of the grades and store the
result.

Display a message that includes the student's name and the result of the
arithmetic operation, ex:

Josephine, your grade average is 9.666666666666666
