## Exercises: Pseudocode
These exercises are designed to get you started in thinking like a programmer. In these, we will start writing an informal version of JavaScript. These tasks are meant to be solved *by hand on paper or on a whiteboard*. This means that the code does not have to run on a computer, and we can be more loose with the normal Javascript syntax.

**What is pseudocode?**
Pseudocode is a way to describe the steps of a program using plain language mixed with simple code-like instructions. It helps you plan out your solution before worrying about exact syntax. Pseudocode is not meant to be run by a computer, but should be clear enough that someone else could turn it into real code.

You do not need to use perfect JavaScript syntax. Focus on describing what the program should do, step by step. Use simple variable names, basic math, and clear instructions like "print" or "ask the user".

E.g in normal JavaScript, to add two numbers and print the output we would write:

```js
let a = 5;
let b = 7;
console.log(a + b);
```

But in our informal version, the following will also be correct:

```
a = 5
b = 7
print a + b
```

### Task 1:
Write pseudocode to add two numbers and show the result.

*Hint:* Think about what variables you need, how to add them, and how to show the answer. You can choose any numbers you like.

### Task 2:
Write pseudocode to ask the user for their name and then print a greeting.

*Hint:* Imagine you are talking to the user. First, ask for their name and store it in a variable. Then print a message that uses their name, like "Hello, Anna!".

### Task 3:
Write pseudocode to calculate the total price for 3 apples if each apple costs 4 units. Print the total price.

*Hint:* You can use variables for the number of apples and the price per apple. Multiply them to get the total, then print the result. Try changing the numbers to see what happens!
